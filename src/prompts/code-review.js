### üîç Review Configuration
**Scope:** ${scope.toUpperCase()}
**Focus:** ${focus.toUpperCase()}
${filePattern ? `**File Pattern:** ${filePattern}` : ''}

### üìã Pre-Review Setup

**Step 1: Project Understanding**
- Access \`info://server\` for server architecture details
- Access \`config://app\` for application configuration
- Use \`list-files\` with "*" to understand project structure

**Step 2: File Analysis**
${scope === 'full' ? `
- Review all JavaScript files: \`list-files\` with "*.js"
- Check configuration files: \`list-files\` with "*.json"
- Examine documentation: \`list-files\` with "*.md"
- Review scripts: \`list-files\` with "*.sh"
` : scope === 'specific' && filePattern ? `
- Focus on specific pattern: \`list-files\` with "${filePattern}"
- Analyze related configuration files
- Check documentation for affected areas
` : `
- Identify changed files using file listing tools
- Map dependencies and related components
- Check configuration impact

### üîß Review Process

**Phase 1: Discovery**
1. \`list-files\` with pattern "*" - Overall structure
2. Access \`config://app\` - Application configuration
3. Access \`info://server\` - Server information
4. \`list-files\` with "*.json" - Configuration files

**Phase 2: Code Analysis**
${filePattern ? `
- Focus on \`list-files\` with "${filePattern}"
- Analyze specific file types and patterns
- Review related configuration and documentation
` : `
- \`list-files\` with "*.js" - JavaScript implementation
- \`list-files\` with "*.md" - Documentation review  
- \`list-files\` with "*.sh" - Script and automation review
`}

**Phase 3: Quality Assessment**
- Evaluate code against quality standards
- Check for security vulnerabilities
- Assess performance implications
- Review maintainability factors
